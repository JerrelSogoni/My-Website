# My-Website
My personal website, written in Angular 2 front end and backend PHP due to web hosting service support. Can easily be adapted to Node.js
Just wanted to learn a new front end technology as well as make a website from scratch using angular-cli for a quick start for intializing angular2.
Learned about core angular 2 concepts and PHP for connecting to a database and fetching MySQL data. I could have used various lanugages for backend such as Node.js but namecheap requires a seperate hosting for that service. I could have used Python but I am very familiar with Python so I decided to go to a lanugage I was not too familiar with.
